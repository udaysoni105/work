Asynchronous programming Asynchronous programming is a multithreaded model
that’s most applicable to networking and communications. Asynchronous is a
non-blocking architecture, which means it doesn’t block further execution while
one or more operations are in progress. With asynchronous programming, multiple
related operations can run concurrently without waiting for other tasks to
complete. During asynchronous communication, parties receive and process
messages when it’s convenient or possible, rather than responding immediately

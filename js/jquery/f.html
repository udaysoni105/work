The problem with above statement is that the selectors is having meta characters
and to use any of the meta-characters (such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ )
as a literal part of a name, it must be escaped with with two backslashes: \\.
For example, an element with id="foo.bar", can use the selector $("#foo\\.bar").
So the correct syntax is, $('#myid\\.3').text('blah blah!!!');
